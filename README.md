# Cocktail-Index App

A web app that **displays** data and information about cocktails and how they are mixed.
Information is acquired from [TheCocktailDB](https://pokeapi.co/).

The responsive application shows a list of cocktail names in a grid. Each cocktail has a button which opens a modal with an image of the cocktail, what ingredients are needed and how it is prepared. The cocktails can be searched by name.
